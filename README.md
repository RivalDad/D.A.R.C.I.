Data Analysis, Reconnaissance and Cooperative Intelligence

But you can call me Darci.

HomeAssistant at the core, I'm the central location for monitoring all things in the house. I have sensors (Light, motion, temp, external API calls, etc.) that help me watch and advise. I'm designed to be the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and skin for the house. When I'm told, things are outside of acceptable paratmeters.

Things that I help out with now, is monitoring temperatures, light levels, crypto coin prices, phone calls.

The next step is to include H20 sensors for leak detection, Smoke and O2 alarms incase of fire, door and window sensors, and security cameras.

A full overview is in the works, but it will take some time as the project has grown large since documenting.
